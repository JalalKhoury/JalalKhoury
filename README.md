I am an Industrial and Logistics engineer with a strong interest in applying blockchain and Web3 technologies to real-world industrial and business challenges. I build smart-contract prototypes using Solidity and Hardhat, focusing on how decentralized systems can enhance supply-chain processes such as procurement, invoicing, payments, traceability, coordination between actors, and trust automation. My background combines engineering rigor with practical operational thinking, allowing me to translate complex supply-chain workflows into clear, auditable, and programmable logic on-chain. I use GitHub to publish clean, documented, and test-driven projects that explore the intersection of supply chain, finance, and decentralized technologies.
